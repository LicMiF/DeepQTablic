# DeepQTablic
Reinforcement learning agent for playing popular Serbian game "Tablic" in a multiplayer setting. The goal of the project was to show that state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied
to complex stohastic game environments such as those found in card game "Tablic". It was shown that the DQN agent was able to learn optimal policy, defeating team of greedy players in around 70 percent of played games.
During the course of the project, numerous extensions to DQN algorithm were tested, such as n-step learning and prioritised replay buffer and they did not yield better results when compared to traditional approach.
